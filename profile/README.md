## Overview  

Blocs for Mac is a powerful visual web design tool that enables users to create responsive, modern websites without writing a single line of code. Designed for both professionals and beginners, it combines the flexibility of traditional design applications with the structure and precision of web development. Its intuitive drag-and-drop interface allows users to build layouts visually, add interactive elements, and preview their projects in real time.  

This app streamlines the web creation process by offering pre-built “blocs” — reusable design sections that you can stack, rearrange, and customize. It integrates seamlessly with modern web technologies like HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap, ensuring that every site built with Blocs looks great on all devices. You can customize every visual aspect, from typography to animation, while still keeping the underlying code clean and production-ready.  

Blocs is also ideal for designers who prefer working visually but need developer-level output. Its smart export options let you host sites anywhere, connect to CMS platforms, and even extend functionality with custom code. The built-in project manager makes organizing large websites simple, while live previews show exactly how your design will look on different screen sizes.  

With support for macOS Monterey, Ventura, and beyond, Blocs continues to evolve with new features such as global swatches, instant preview syncing, and reusable templates. It’s a perfect tool for anyone looking to design professional, high-performance websites entirely on Mac — from portfolios and landing pages to full-scale business sites.
